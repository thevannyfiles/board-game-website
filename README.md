### Track 1: Board Game Cafe Website
Sip & Play is a board game cafe spot in NYC. We were tasked with creating a brand new website using HTML, CSS, Javascript, Three.js, or A-frame. The following criteria for the website are as follows: an events calendar, approachable UI/UX design, a 3D menu, mobile-friendly, SEO-friendly, and creative. We decided to focus on the UI/UX experience specifically, but not limited to the mobile since most people will use their mobile phones to access the website.


## UI/UX

We worked to condense the website for better usability, optimizing the information displayed on small screens while maintaining an attractive design.

The home page was redesigned to help users understand what Sip & Play is about. We grouped the description and a link for making reservations at the top, highlighted games and events, and brought Magic: The Gathering to the forefront.

We used a carousel to showcase highlighted games and events, ensuring the display is mobile-friendly without losing interactivity. Additionally, we condensed some pages by consolidating everything related to "play" into one section and moved the press/news area to the bottom of the "About Us" section to highlight the caf√©.

## 3D Menu

Creating the 3D menu aspect of the project was particularly challenging. We explored different ways to create a 3D menu while ensuring it was mobile-friendly and not just dynamic on the webpage. After extensive brainstorming, we revamped the original menu styling by replacing the static image with a dynamic 3D image that runs smoothly on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Technologies 

We used HTML, Tailwind, and React + Vite to build our project.

Tailwind helped expedite the styling process of the site. We included a calendar to display all events, highlighting the upcoming and main events in a dedicated section
